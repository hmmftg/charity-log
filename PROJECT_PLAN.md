# Healthcare Management System - Project Plan & Documentation

## Project Overview

This is a comprehensive healthcare management system designed for charity clinics, built with modern web technologies to efficiently manage patient visits, treatments, and medical records.

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Go 1.24.4 with Gin framework
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript with Refine framework
- **UI Framework**: Material-UI (MUI) v6
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with comprehensive schema
- **Authentication**: Custom JWT-based system
- **Build Tools**: Vite for frontend, Go modules for backend

### Current Implementation Status

#### ‚úÖ Completed Components
1. **Database Schema**: Complete PostgreSQL schema with RLS policies
2. **Basic Backend Structure**: Go application with Gin framework
3. **Frontend Foundation**: React app with Refine framework
4. **Authentication Framework**: Basic UMS (User Management System)
5. **Internationalization**: Persian/English support with RTL
6. **Basic Doctor Management**: CRUD operations for doctors

#### üîÑ In Progress
1. **Patient Management**: Basic structure exists, needs full implementation
2. **Visit Logging**: Schema ready, controllers needed
3. **Medical Records**: Database tables exist, UI components needed

#### ‚ùå Missing Components
1. **Complete Patient Management System**
2. **Visit Documentation & Logging**
3. **Medical Image Upload System**
4. **Therapy Scheduling System**
5. **Admin Dashboard with Analytics**
6. **Role-based Access Control**
7. **Mobile/Tablet Optimization**
8. **File Management System**

## Database Schema Overview

### Core Tables
1. **profiles** - User profiles extending auth.users
2. **patients** - Patient-specific information
3. **doctors** - Doctor profiles and specializations
4. **visits** - Visit records with diagnoses and treatments
5. **visit_images** - Medical images and documents
6. **therapy_schedules** - Patient therapy scheduling

### Security Features
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- Role-based access control policies
- Audit trails with created/updated timestamps
- Encrypted data storage considerations

## User Roles & Permissions

### Admin Users
- Full system access and user management
- Clinic statistics and analytics dashboard
- Patient and doctor data oversight
- System configuration and settings

### Doctor Users
- Patient visit logging and documentation
- Medical record access and updates
- Appointment management
- Treatment planning and follow-up scheduling

### Patient Users
- Personal medical history access
- Appointment viewing and management
- Therapy schedule tracking
- Secure communication with healthcare providers

## Technical Requirements

### Backend Requirements
